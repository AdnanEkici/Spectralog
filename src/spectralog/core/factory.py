class ApplicationLoggerBuilderFactory:
    """Compose the dependency graph required to build a SpectraLog application logger.

    ``ApplicationLoggerBuilderFactory`` is responsible for constructing and
    connecting the concrete formatter, handler, path-resolution, and
    multiprocessing components used by :class:`ApplicationLoggerBuilder`.

    The factory centralizes dependency composition so that
    :class:`ApplicationLoggerBuilder` can focus exclusively on logger construction
    and orchestration. Components are created with the dependencies they require
    and then assembled into a fully configured builder for the supplied
    :class:`LoggerConfiguration`.

    A shared :class:`LogLevelRegistry` is retained by the factory and passed to
    formatter infrastructure so that standard and dynamically registered log
    levels use a consistent set of severity and color definitions.

    A single :class:`RelativePathFilter` instance is shared by the standard
    console, file, and syslog handler factories. This ensures that relative source
    path information is populated consistently across supported logging
    destinations.

    File formatting is composed through a :class:`FileFormatterResolver` with
    ordered formatting strategies. JSON formatting is evaluated before plain-text
    formatting, allowing JSON logging configuration to select the JSON formatter
    while plain-text formatting remains the fallback strategy.

    The factory also assembles the multiprocessing file logging pipeline by
    combining the queue handler factory with the standard file handler factory.
    This allows the resulting builder to choose between direct file logging and
    queue-based multiprocessing logging according to the active configuration.

    Calling :meth:`create` constructs a new dependency graph and returns a fully
    composed :class:`ApplicationLoggerBuilder`. The logger itself is not created
    until the returned builder's :meth:`ApplicationLoggerBuilder.build` method is
    invoked."""

        self,
        log_level_registry: LogLevelRegistry,

        """Initialize the factory with the shared SpectraLog log-level registry.

        infrastructure so that standard and dynamically registered log levels share
        the same severity and color definitions.

            log_level_registry:

        """Create a fully composed :class:`ApplicationLoggerBuilder`.

        Constructs the complete dependency graph required by
        :class:`ApplicationLoggerBuilder` for the supplied logger configuration.

        The factory creates the format builder, relative-path filter, formatter
        factories, file formatter strategies, handler factories, multiprocessing
        logging components, syslog handler factory, and log-file path resolver.

        A single :class:`RelativePathFilter` instance is shared by the standard
        console, file, and syslog handler factories so that source-path enrichment is
        applied consistently across those logging destinations.

        File formatting is resolved through ordered strategies. JSON formatting is
        evaluated before plain-text formatting so that a configured
        :class:`JsonLoggerConfiguration` selects the JSON formatter when applicable,
        while plain-text formatting acts as the fallback.

        The returned builder is configured with all collaborators required to build a
        logger, but no logger or handler is created until
        :meth:`ApplicationLoggerBuilder.build` is called.

        Args:
            configuration:
                The :class:`LoggerConfiguration` that will be associated with the
                created builder and used when the builder later constructs the
                application logger.
