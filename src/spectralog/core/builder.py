class ApplicationLoggerBuilder:
    """Build and configure the standard-library logger used by SpectraLog.

    ``ApplicationLoggerBuilder`` is responsible for orchestrating construction of
    the underlying :class:`logging.Logger` used by :class:`ApplicationLogger`.

    The builder applies the active :class:`LoggerConfiguration`, resets any
    existing handlers on the target logger, configures the effective logging
    level, and attaches the appropriate console, file, multiprocessing, and syslog
    handlers.

    Handler construction is delegated to injected factories rather than performed
    directly by the builder. This keeps the class focused on composition and
    lifecycle orchestration while allowing individual handler implementations to
    remain independently configurable and testable.

    Console output is always configured. When Rich console configuration is
    present, the Rich handler factory is used; otherwise the standard console
    handler factory is selected.

    When persistent logging is enabled, the log file path is resolved before file
    output is configured. Depending on the ``multiprocessing_safe`` setting,
    records are written either through a direct file handler or through
    SpectraLog's multiprocessing logging runtime.

    When syslog configuration is present, a syslog handler is attached in addition
    to the configured console and file-related handlers.

    Before applying a new configuration, all handlers currently attached to the
    named logger are removed and closed. Logger propagation is disabled after
    configuration to prevent duplicate records from being processed by ancestor
    loggers.

    The :meth:`build` method returns a :class:`LoggerBuildResult` containing the
    configured logger together with metadata required by
    :class:`ApplicationLogger`, including the resolved log file path, whether the
    log file is new or empty, and the optional multiprocessing logging runtime."""

        A Rich console handler is selected when Rich configuration is present;
