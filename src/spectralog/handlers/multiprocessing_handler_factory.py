    """Create the queue-based logging infrastructure used for multiprocessing-safe file logging.

    ``MultiprocessingHandlerFactory`` assembles the components required to route
    log records through a multiprocessing queue before they are written to the
    configured file handler.

    The factory creates a process-compatible log-record queue, a queue handler
    that publishes records into that queue, a file handler that performs the
    actual persistent write, and a :class:`logging.handlers.QueueListener` that
    consumes queued records and forwards them to the file handler.

    The listener is configured with ``respect_handler_level=True`` so that the
    effective level configured on the downstream file handler remains authoritative.

    The resulting components are wrapped in a
    :class:`MultiprocessingLoggingRuntime`, which owns their lifecycle and is
    responsible for starting and stopping the listener and releasing queue-related
    resources.

    This factory creates the multiprocessing logging infrastructure but does not
    start it. Runtime startup is handled by :class:`ApplicationLogger`."""
