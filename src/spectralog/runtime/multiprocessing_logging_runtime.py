class MultiprocessingLoggingRuntime:
    """Manage the lifecycle of SpectraLog's multiprocessing logging pipeline.

    ``MultiprocessingLoggingRuntime`` owns the queue handler, queue listener, and
    multiprocessing queue used for queue-based file logging.

    The runtime provides explicit :meth:`start` and :meth:`stop` operations and
    tracks whether the listener is currently running or whether the runtime has
    already been permanently closed.

    Lifecycle operations are protected by a reentrant lock so that state changes
    remain consistent when multiple threads attempt to start, stop, or inspect the
    runtime concurrently.

    Starting the runtime launches the configured
    :class:`logging.handlers.QueueListener`. Stopping the runtime first stops the
    listener when necessary, then closes the queue handler and multiprocessing
    queue, waits for the queue's feeder thread to terminate, and marks the runtime
    as closed.

    A closed runtime cannot be started again. Both :meth:`start` and :meth:`stop`
    are safe to call repeatedly without duplicating lifecycle operations."""
