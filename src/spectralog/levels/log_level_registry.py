class LogLevelRegistry:
    """Manage SpectraLog log-level definitions, validation, and color mappings.

    ``LogLevelRegistry`` stores the standard and custom log levels available to a
    SpectraLog application logger.

    The registry initializes with the standard DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, and
    CRITICAL levels and their default :class:`LoggerColor` values. Additional
    levels may be registered dynamically through :meth:`register`.

    Level names are normalized by trimming surrounding whitespace and converting
    the result to uppercase before validation and lookup. Valid names must begin
    with a letter and may contain only letters, numbers, and underscores.

    Custom colors are validated against the color names supported by
    ``colorlog``, and severity values must be positive integers. Boolean values are
    explicitly rejected even though ``bool`` is a subclass of ``int`` in Python.

    Both level names and numeric severities must remain unique within the
    registry. Registering a duplicate name or reusing a severity already assigned
    to another level raises :class:`SpectraLogLevelAlreadyExistsError`.

    Registration is protected by an internal lock so that validation against the
    current registry state and insertion of a new level occur atomically when
    multiple threads attempt to register levels concurrently.

    Registered levels are also published to Python's standard logging subsystem
    through :func:`logging.addLevelName`, allowing their numeric severities to be
    associated with the same normalized names outside the registry.

    The :attr:`colors` property exposes the current mapping between registered
    level names and their configured color values for use by compatible console
    formatters."""
