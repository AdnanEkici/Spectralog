class LogFilePathResolver:
    """Resolve the effective file-system path used for SpectraLog file logging.

    ``LogFilePathResolver`` determines where SpectraLog should write persistent
    log output based on the active :class:`LoggerConfiguration`.

    The resolver ensures that the configured logs directory exists before
    constructing the final file path. When a custom ``log_file_name`` is supplied,
    that name is used relative to the configured logs directory. When no custom
    name is supplied, a daily file name is generated from the current local date.

    JSON logging changes the effective file extension to ``.jsonl``. Plain-text
    logging uses the supplied custom extension unchanged, or ``.log`` for
    automatically generated daily files.

    The resolver is responsible only for determining the log file path and
    creating the top-level logs directory. It does not create or open the log file
    itself."""
